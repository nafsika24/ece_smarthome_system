# Mini Smarthome System :iphone: :bulb:

Our System aims to give you the ability to secure and monitor your home using a smartphone or tablet through an internet connection. The functionalities provided are:
* Alert user in case of a possible break into the house, using the alarm system.
* ALert user in case of fire or high levels of dangerous gases.
* Alert user if the doorbell is ringing.
* ALert user if the fridgefoor was left open for several minutes or the faucet or oven was left open while no one is in the house.
* Control (open/close) the lights, the television, the radio and the coffee maker.
* Control the heatig system.
* Inform user about the energy consumption.
* Show many timestamp graphs for the above functionalities

The system was developed using the tool [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/). 

We assume that the messages we retrieve (for the several states of the house) are from sensors. These sensors send data at Node-Red using the [Mosquitto MQTT Brocker](https://mosquitto.org/). Node-Red recieves those messages and stores the in a database. In case of need for alert, the user will recieve messages at a [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel. 

THe file flows.json contains all the flows of the system. By uploading it at Node-Red you can see them. The flows contain connection to PostgreSQL Database and Mosquitto MQTT Brocker.

For the visualisation of all the states we used the tool [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). You can import the file FILEEEEE and see a demo of visualisations and the control of the devices.

For the control of the devices (e.x. lights) you will use Grafana's Dashboard, where there are several buttons for that purpose. As Grafana can not send MQTT requests when a button is clicked, we developed a simple API, which listens at user's controls and sends MQTT requests.

As we do not have real sensors, we will simulate them by using python scripts. In the folder data_scripts you will find the test_script.sh. By running it all the contained scripts begin simultaneously to send MQTT requests every five minutes, with hypothetical timestamp data from the house's sensors.  

### Build note 
* To open Node-Red, after installing it, run on your terminal "node-red" and open the link http://127.0.0.1:1880/.
* To open Grafana , after installing it, run on your terminal "sudo systemctl start grafana-server" and open http://localhost:3000/.
* 
* Slack channel for alert messages: https://join.slack.com/t/smarthomeapplication/shared_invite/zt-14gi1xq83-nAKqM6GHoSK8J4joeC5u0Q

* In the file mqtt there are some examples of MQTT Requests you can send. 
* 
* To run data scripts, first run on your terminal "pip install paho-mqtt". In order to run all scripts simultaneously, in the terminal, the folder data_scripts:
  1. run chmod +x test_scripts.sh
  2. run ./test_scripts.sh
